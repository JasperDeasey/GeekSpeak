# GeekSpeak

### Background
This project was made for the 2021 [BizHacks Hackathon](https://www.bizhacks.ca/), with a goal of improving the BestBuy search experience by making it more accessible.


### Usage
GeekSpeak is a web application. It can run in http://localhost:3000/ after inputting the commands *npm install* and *npm start*.

### How it's made
The application is created in javascript using next.js, react.js, and Material UI. The Natural Language Processing is done with calls to an API.

### Challenges
This project was my first time using react.js; however, the framework was extremely intuitive to use. The Natural Language Processing also posed a challenge, due to the constant, asyncronous call to the api.

### Accomplishments
We are very proud of having made this application in under 24 hours. It was a learning experience and required every team member to work hard to create this product so quickly.
